# Leetcode Helper

This basic C++ library provides utility functions for mainly solving Leetcode problems (amongst others) that simplify common tasks such as input/output handling and data structure construction. It is designed to help you focus on solving problems rather than spending time setting up the necessary input/output infrastructure.

The library *should* work on all platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac).

Checkout the functions the library has to offer at src/. Comments are included to help understand what each function does.
